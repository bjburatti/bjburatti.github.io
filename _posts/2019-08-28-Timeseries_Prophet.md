# Northstar Contributors Guidelines

Before asking any question please check out the dedicated **[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/c/northstar/questions)** directory. Most of the people incur in the same kind of problems hence you will probably find good information to solve your problem using the repo.

At this point three scenarios are possible:

1.  you found the solution to your problem: nothing to do!
2.  you partially solved your problem, but you need additional insight regarding an already posted question: write a follow-up comment.
3.  you did not solve your problem: write a new question on Stackoverflow.


Consider that those are guidelines and that actual way to interact with the depends on the task and people you need to work with/on.

*The single, most important thing is to *document any relevant interaction that can be useful to the others.*
